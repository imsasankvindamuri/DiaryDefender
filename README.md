Heya! My name is `Sai Sasank`, although online I prefer going by `NotAUniquePerson`. This is a simple project for me to get back into programming.

While it will be initially simplistic, I intend to make it a sophisticated resume-worthy project by the end of it.

# The Concept #

I have a `diary` file which I don't want people to read. The idea is `to request a password for access`.
Over time I could add other features like scrambling, encryption, and other security measures. I'll update the README.md file every time I make a major update.

### Goals To Achieve: ###

- Create a simple text-editor.
- Add a password feature.
- Encrypt the files so that the information stays secure.
  
I'll update once I get some progress in this. Thanks for viewing!
