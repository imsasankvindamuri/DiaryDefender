Heya! My name is `Sai Sasank`, although online I prefer going by `NotAUniquePerson`. This is a simple project for me to get back into programming.

While it will be initially simplistic, I intend to make it a sophisticated resume-worthy project by the end of it.

# The Concept #

I have a `diary.txt` file which I don't want people to read. The idea is `to request a password for access`.
Over time I could add other features like scrambling, encryption, and other security measures. I'll update the README.md file every time I make a major update.

### Goals To Achieve: ###

- Write a program to execute when `diary.txt` has been opened.
- Modify to ask for a password.
- Try to find a way to deny access to the .txt file if the password is wrong.

Note: The above list is subject to change.

Edit 1: Corrected Grammar and clarified intent.
